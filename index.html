        <p>
          WE ARE A RELIGION THAT FINDS OUR MEANING IN THE CONSTANT PURSUIT OF MATERIAL GOODS. 
        </p>

        <p>
          WE ARE A RELIGION OF BUYERS, NOT USERS. WE ARE COMMITTED TO HYPER-CONSUMERISM AND HYPO-CONSUMPTION — WE BUY, THEN THROW AWAY; BUY, THEN THROW AWAY.
        </p>

        <p>
          WE ARE A RELIGION OF SINGLE-USE-MINDED INDIVIDUALS. OUR OBJECTS ARE DESIGNED FOR OBSOLESCENCE.
        </p>

        <p>
          WE ARE A RELIGION THAT CANNOT COMPREHEND THE VALUE OF AN OBJECT IF WE CANNOT POSSESS IT. POSSESSION IS THE FINAL STAGE OF AN OBJECT’S LIFE, THE HIGHEST VALUE WE CAN ATTRIBUTE TO IT. THEREAFTER, ITS WORTH DECREASES; ITS APPEAL DIES.   
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          WE ARE A RELIGION THAT FEEDS ON SCARCITY AND EXCESS SIMULTANEOUSLY. WE GLORIFY THE LIMITED EDITION, THE RARE, THE EXCLUSIVE, BUT WE DEMAND INFINITE ACCESS TO MORE. MORE OF EVERYTHING, MORE OF ANYTHING.

        </p>

        <p>
          WE ARE A VAIN RELIGION. OUR POSSESSIONS ARE A PATH TO VALIDATION, TO ELEVATED IMAGE AND STATUS.
        </p>

          <img src="cross.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          WE ARE A DEVOUT RELIGION — OUR DEVOTION TO MATERIAL GOODS IS OUR WAY, OUR TRUTH, AND OUR LIFE. CONSUMERISM IS OUR SALVATION. WE SEEK REDEMPTION THROUGH POSSESSION. 
        </p>

          <img src="cross.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          WE ARE A RELIGION OF FLEETING DESIRES. OUR FAITH IS SUSTAINED BY THE NEXT PURCHASE, THE NEXT UPGRADE, THE NEXT RELEASE. TO DELAY IS TO DENY OUR CREED; TO WAIT IS TO BETRAY OUR ESSENCE.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="cross.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          WE ARE A RELIGION OF TRENDS AND NOVELTY. WHAT IS NEW IS HOLY, WHAT IS OLD IS PROFANE.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="cross.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          WE ARE A RELIGION OF ENDLESS ACCUMULATION. OUR PRAYERS ARE MADE IN THE FORM OF CREDIT CARD SWIPES, AND OUR ALTAR IS THE SHOPPING CART, FULL AND OVERFLOWING. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN ENOUGH. ENOUGH IS A SIN AGAINST OUR VERY DOCTRINE.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="cross.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          WE ARE A RELIGION THAT IS ONLY CONCERNED WITH THE SHORT-TERM. WE SEEK SHORT-TERM SATISFACTION, AND OUR OBJECTS ARE DESIGNED FOR A SHORT-TERM WORLD — A WORLD THAT WILL DIE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. 
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="cross.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          WE ARE A RELIGION OF LITTLE EMPATHY. WE CARE LITTLE FOR THE EXPLOITATION OF UNDERPAID WORKERS, OF ANIMALS, AND THE EARTH. WE CARE ONLY FOR OURSELVES AND WHAT WE MAY POSSESS.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="cross.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          WE ARE A RELIGION THAT TRANSCENDS BORDERS. WE ARE THE CONSUMERIST RELIGION.
